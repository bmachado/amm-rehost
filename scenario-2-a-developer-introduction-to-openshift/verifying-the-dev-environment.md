# Verifying the Dev Environment

## 1. Verify Application

You can review the above resources in the OpenShift Web Console or using the oc get or oc describe commands \(oc describe gives more detailed info\):

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use short synonyms for long words, like bc instead of buildconfig, and is for imagestream, dc for deploymentconfig, svc for service, etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't worry about reading and understanding the output of oc describe. Just make sure the command doesn't report errors!
{% endhint %}

Run these commands to inspect the elements:

```bash
oc get bc coolstore
```

```bash
oc get is coolstore
```

```bash
oc get dc coolstore
```

```bash
oc get svc coolstore
```

```bash
oc describe route www
```

Verify that you can access the monolith by clicking on the exposed OpenShift route at

http://www-\[your-username\]-coolstore-dev.apps.\[EVENT-NAME\].openshiftworkshop.com to open up the sample application in a separate browser tab. Full link is listed in Requested Host attribute.

You should also be able to see both the CoolStore monolith and its database running in separate pods:

```bash
oc get pods -l application=coolstore
```

The output should look like this:

```text
NAME                           READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
coolstore-2-bpkkc              1/1 Running 0 4m
coolstore-postgresql-1-jpcb8   1/1 Running 0 9m
```

##  ****2. Verify Database

You can log into the running Postgres container using the following:

```bash
oc rsh dc/coolstore-postgresql
```

Once logged in, use the following command to execute an SQL statement to show some content from the database:

```bash
psql -U $POSTGRESQL_USER $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE -c 'select name from PRODUCT_CATALOG;'
```

`$POSTGRESQL_USER` and `$POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` environment variables are already defined. If you want to check tem run the following commands:

```text
echo $POSTGRESQL_USER
echo $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
```

You should see the following:

```bash
         name
------------------------
 Red Fedora
 Forge Laptop Sticker
 Solid Performance Polo
 Ogio Caliber Polo
 16 oz. Vortex Tumbler
 Atari 2600 Joystick
 Pebble Smart Watch
 Oculus Rift
 Lytro Camera
(9 rows)
```

Don't forget to exit the pod's shell with exit

```bash
sh-4.2$ exit
```

You can also login in the management web console and run the same SQL query from your browser since Openshift provides a terminal window. Access [https://master.\[EVENT-NAME\].openshiftworkshop.com/console](about:blank) and follow the steps below:

Choose the **Coolstore Monolith - Dev** in the projects menu.

Go to **terminal** tab menu

Run the same SQL Query command you executed previously:

```bash
psql -U $POSTGRESQL_USER $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE -c 'select name from PRODUCT_CATALOG;'
```

Also, explore the Environment tab also available and see the same environment variables youâ€™ve seen before.

With our running project on OpenShift, in the next step we'll explore how you as a developer can work with the running app to make changes and debug the application!

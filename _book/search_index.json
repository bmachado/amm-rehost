In project explorer, open src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml to see one of these descriptors.\n\nAnother possibility to open weblogic-ejb-jar.xml is to use the ctrl+shift+r shortcut and fill the search with weblogic-ejb-jar name.\n\nThere are many different configuration possibilities for EJBs and MDBs in this file, but luckily our application only uses one of them, namely it configures  to 30, which means that if a given transaction within an MDB operation takes too long to complete (over 30 seconds), then the transaction is rolled back and exceptions are thrown.

Execute the ls command inside the container to see this:\noc  rsh dc/coolstore ls -l /opt/eap\n\nYou should see a listing of files in this directory in the running container.  \nIt is very important to remember where commands are executed! If you think you are in a container and in fact are on some other machine, destructive commands may do real harm, so be careful! In general it is not a good idea to operate inside immutable containers outside of the development environment. But for doing testing and debugging it's OK.  \nLet's copy some files out of the running container. To copy files from a running container on OpenShift, we'll use the oc rsync command. This command expects the name of the pod to copy from, which can be seen with this command:  \noc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=coolstore\n\nThe output should show you the name of the pod:  \n\n\n\nNAME\nREADY\nSTATUS\nRESTARTS\nAGE\n\n\n\n\nCoolstore-2-bpkkc\n1/1\nRunning\n0\n32m\n\n\n\nThe name of my running coolstore monolith pod is coolstore-2-bpkkc but yours will be different.  \nSave the name of the pod into an environment variable called COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME so that we can use it for future\nCommands:  \nexport COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME=$(oc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=coolstore -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.status.phase==\"Running\")].metadata.name}')\n\nVerify the variable holds the name of your pod with:\necho $COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME\n\nNext, run the oc rsync command in your terminal window, using the new variable to refer to the name of the pod running our coolstore:\noc  rsync $COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME:/opt/eap/version.txt .\n\nThe output will show that the file was downloaded:\nreceiving incremental file list version.txt\nsent 30 bytes received 65 bytes 62,566.00 bytes/sec total size is 65 speedup is 1.00\nNow you can open the file locally using the command below and inspect its contents.\ncat version.txt\n\nThis is useful for verifying that the contents of files in your applications are what you expect.\n"},"scenario-2-a-developer-introduction-to-openshift/before-moving-on.html":{"url":"scenario-2-a-developer-introduction-to-openshift/before-moving-on.html","title":"Before moving on","keywords":"","body":"Before moving on\nLet's clean up the temp files we used.

When there is a change to a file, the changed file will be automatically copied up to the container.  \nThis same process can also be run in the opposite direction if required, with changes made in the container being automatically copied back to your local computer.  \nAn example of where it can be useful to have changes automatically copied from your local computer into the container is during the development of an application.  \nFor scripted programming languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Python or Ruby, where no separate compilation phase is required you can perform live code development with your application running inside of OpenShift.  \nFor JBoss EAP applications you can sync individual files (such as HTML/CSS/JS files), or sync entire application .WAR files. It's more challenging to synchronize individual files as it requires that you use an exploded archive deployment, so the use of JBoss Developer Studio is recommended, which automates this process (see these docs for more info).

There is no running production app just yet. The only running app is back in the dev environment, where you used a binary build to run the app previously.\nOpenShift, using Kubernetes health probes, offers a solution for monitoring application health and try to automatically heal faulty containers through restarting them to fix issues such as a deadlock in the application which can be resolved by restarting the container. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.\nFurthermore, there are of course a category of issues that can’t be resolved by restarting the container. In those scenarios, OpenShift would remove the faulty container from the built-in load-balancer and send traffic only to the healthy container remained.  \nThere are two type of health probes available in OpenShift: liveness probes and readiness probes. Liveness probes are to know when to restart a container and readiness probes to know when a Container is ready to start accepting traffic.\nOnly execute these steps with your Jenkins has warning messages or errors. It's not required if its running well.\nNow we need to increase the timeout of readiness and liveness probes. Click in the jenkins application link.\n\nThen, go to Actions -> Edit Health Checks\n\nSet 480 timeout seconds to both readiness and liveness probes.\n\nAfter that, click in save button.\nIn the next step, we'll promote the app from the dev environment to the production environment using an OpenShift pipeline build.

Ordinarily the pipeline would contain steps to build the project in the dev environment, store the resulting image in the local repository, run the image and execute tests against it, then wait for human approval to promote the resulting image to other environments like test or production.\n\nInspect the Pipeline Definition\n\nOur pipeline is somewhat simplified for the purposes of this Workshop. Inspect the contents of the pipeline using the following command:\noc projects\noc project [your-username]-coolstore-prod\noc describe bc/monolith-pipeline\n\nYou can see the Jenkinsfile definition of the pipeline in the output:\nJenkinsfile contents:\n  node ('maven') {\n    stage 'Build'\n    sleep 5\n\n    stage 'Run Tests in DEV'\n    sleep 10\n\n    stage 'Deploy to PROD'\n    openshiftTag(sourceStream: 'coolstore', sourceTag: 'latest', namespace: 'coolstore-dev', destinationStream: 'coolstore', destinationTag: 'prod', destinationNamespace: 'coolstore-prod')\n    sleep 10\n\n    stage 'Run Tests in PROD'\n    sleep 30\n  }\n\nNote that source namespace refers to coolstore-dev and destinationNamespace to coolstore-prod. We will need to add [your-username]- in the coolstore-dev and coolstore-prod project name to associate the pipeline to the project created in the previous lab. It will be done in the next steps.\nPipeline syntax allows creating complex deployment scenarios with the possibility of defining checkpoint for manual interaction and approval process using the large set of steps and plugins that Jenkins provides in order to adapt the pipeline to the process used in your team. You can see a few examples of advanced pipelines in the OpenShift GitHub Repository.\nTo simplify the pipeline in this workshop, we simulate the build and tests and skip any need for human input. Once the pipeline completes, it deploys the app from the dev environment to our production environment using the above openshiftTag() method, which simply re-tags the image you already created using a tag which will trigger deployment in the production environment.\n\nPromote the dev image to production using the pipeline\n\nYou can use the oc command line to invoke the build pipeline, or the Web Console. Let's use the Web Console.\nFirst of all, let's ensure coolstore-prod has the user groups needed to run the pipeline. Return to the main page by clicking in openshift logo on the left top corner.\n\nClick in the button next to the [your-username]-coolstore-dev project -> View Membership.\n\nNavigate to Service Groups, notice that system:serviceaccounts:coolstore-prod doesn't exist. The correct name is coolstore-prod instead, so the pipeline won't run successfully, it can't get the image streams in the -dev namespace. You can do the same steps in coolstore-prod project to check the service accounts created to its project.\n\nThe pipeline copies the ROOT.war running in developer to product environment. Without the correct service account in coolstore-dev project the image streams \"coolstore\" is forbidden and the pipeline created in coolstore-prod will thrown errors. So, click in Edit Membership button.\n\nAdd a new group called system:serviceaccounts:coolstore-prod with the admin role.\n\nRemove the wrong role called system.serviceaccounts:coolstore-prod.\n\nClick in Remove button to confirm it and Done Editing.\n\nNow, we are going to fix the pipeline.
